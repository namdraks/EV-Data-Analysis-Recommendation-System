#EV-Data-Analysis-Recommendation-System

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of electric vehicle (EV) data using Python, aimed at uncovering insights and building a user-friendly recommendation tool. Key tasks include:

Filtering EVs based on budget and range criteria to support practical decision-making

Grouping data by manufacturer and calculating average battery capacities for benchmarking

Visualizing relationships between battery capacity and range, and identifying outliers in energy consumption
Conducting hypothesis testing to compare engine power between Tesla and Audi, revealing brand performance differences

Developing a Python-based EV recommendation system that suggests suitable models based on user inputs (budget, range, and battery)

This project combines data analysis, statistical testing, and applied machine learning to enhance EV selection strategies and market understanding.
